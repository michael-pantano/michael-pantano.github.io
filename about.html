            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="example-paragraph">I’m a high school senior at Hopkinton Middle High School with a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. As a self-taught programmer, I’ve been learning Python and C++ to deepen my understanding of coding and apply it to real-world challenges. I’m excited to study electrical engineering in college, where I hope to combine my programming skills with a deeper understanding of electronics.

                In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, video games, and the drums. These experiences have helped me develop a balanced perspective and a disciplined approach to my studies and projects.</p>
